# Sosharu - a social network
Sosharu is gonna be a sample social network built with `node-js` and `firebase`.In this application `express` is used to create server and `firebase cloud database` for storing data.Firebase auth is not used because I didn't liked doing so.
### Launch the app
You must have `firebase-tools` and `gulp-cli` installed globaly.Before running the application, run `cd functions` => `npm install` => `npm run gulp` => `npm run watch` to consistently watch scss and js for changes.Run `firebase serve` and configure it with firebase project to serve the application.
# Note:
This project is shutdown in its very early stage.Firebase session are not seemed to work.
